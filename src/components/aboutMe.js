                <p>Over the last decade, my career focus has been solely in dentistry and making my way through orthodontic assisting. I have filled just about every role in the dental clinic with my current credentials. However, I need a fresh start and web development is my siren's call. </p>

                <p>I love to learn and follow my way down rabbit holes of knowledge. Currently I am in the process of gaining more experience with MongoDB, React, Express JS, and Node JS. I would make an great student under an excellent mentor's wing.</p>
