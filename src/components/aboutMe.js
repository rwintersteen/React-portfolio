                <h2 className="h2-text">Over the last decade, my career focus has been solely in dentistry and making my way through orthodontic assisting. I have filled just about every role in the dental clinic with my current credentials. However, I needed a fresh start and web development was my siren's call. I enrolled in the University of Oregon's Coding Bootcamp in April 2021 and expect to graduate with a certificate of completion in October 2021.
